"""
PC-SAFT Model Interaction (Placeholder).

This module provides placeholder functions for interacting with a PC-SAFT
(Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory) equation of state model.
It is intended to be a wrapper around a specific PC-SAFT implementation
(e.g., a library like sgtpy, or custom code).

The functions defined here simulate PC-SAFT calculations for properties
like density and viscosity, returning dummy values.
"""

def calculate_density(components, temperature, pressure):
    """
    Placeholder function to calculate fluid density using PC-SAFT.

    In a real implementation, this function would interface with a PC-SAFT
    library or engine, passing the component parameters, mole fractions,
    temperature, and pressure to calculate the density.

    Args:
        components (list or object): A representation of the fluid components,
                                     including their PC-SAFT parameters and
                                     mole fractions. The exact format will
                                     depend on the chosen PC-SAFT library.
        temperature (float): The temperature in Kelvin (K).
        pressure (float): The pressure in bar or Pascal (Pa), depending on
                          the PC-SAFT library's requirements.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated density, typically in kg/m^3.
               Returns a dummy value (700 kg/m^3) in this placeholder.
    """
    print(f"Calculating density for {components} at T={temperature}K, P={pressure}bar using PC-SAFT (placeholder)")
    # In a real scenario, this would call a PC-SAFT engine with component details
    return 700.0 # kg/m^3 (example value)

def calculate_viscosity(components, temperature, pressure):
    """
    Placeholder function to calculate fluid viscosity using PC-SAFT.

    Similar to density calculation, this would interact with a PC-SAFT
    engine and potentially a viscosity model correlated with PC-SAFT parameters.

    Args:
        components (list or object): A representation of the fluid components,
                                     including their PC-SAFT parameters and
                                     mole fractions.
        temperature (float): The temperature in Kelvin (K).
        pressure (float): The pressure in bar or Pascal (Pa).

    Returns:
        float: The calculated viscosity, typically in centipoise (cP) or PaÂ·s.
               Returns a dummy value (0.5 cP) in this placeholder.
    """
    print(f"Calculating viscosity for {components} at T={temperature}K, P={pressure}bar using PC-SAFT (placeholder)")
    # In a real scenario, this would call a PC-SAFT engine and/or a viscosity correlation
